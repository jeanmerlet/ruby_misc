An exercise on one of the simplest data structures, linked lists, followed by an exercise on the slightly more complicated [binary trees](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/data-structures-and-algorithms?ref=lnav).

Though the functionality of linked lists is completely encapsulated with arrays in Ruby, the point of the [linked lists](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/linked-lists?ref=lnav) exercise was to explore data structures in Ruby.
