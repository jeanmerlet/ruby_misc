Ruby Building Blocks & Advanced Building Blocks

Problems are from [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com):
+ [Building Blocks](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/building-blocks)
+ [Advanced Building Blocks](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/advanced-building-blocks)

My solutions are all .rb script files, which you can copy-paste and run into [this](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_ruby_online.php) online Ruby compiler.

Added Rspec tests in /spec. These tests can be run with $rspec /path/to/test/file.rb, provided that you have Rspec installed.
